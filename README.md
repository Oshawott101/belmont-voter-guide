The Belmont Voter Guide serves as a simple guide, organized by precinct, for the April 6th, 2021 ballot. It includes information on all the roles on the ballots, as well as photos and names of all the candidates on the ballot.
Program Note: After you select your precinct, from 1 through 8, you will need to access the home page on a separate tab to change it.
