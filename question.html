    <h1>Guide To The April 6th Ballot: Question 1</h1>
    <button id = "to_home">Click here to go to the home page.</button>
    <h3><br>What is Question 1?</h3>
    <p>Question 1, commonly known as the override, states: <em>"Shall the Town of Belmont be allowed to assess an additional $6,400,000 in real estate and personal property taxes for the purposes of supplementing the capital budget and the town and school operating budgets for fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2021?</em></p>
    <h3><br>What does Question 1 mean?</h3>
    <p>It basically means that, if passed, Belmont can use an additional $6.4 million from real estate and personal property taxes (i.e. an increase in property taxes for all private properties in Belmont) to revive the capital budget and town and school operating budgets for the fiscal (tax) year starting on July 1, 2021.</p>
    <h3><br>What would happen if Question 1 passes?</h3>
    <p>With the $6.4 million, alongside an extra $4.7 million from the reserves, cuts in services for residents will be eliminated. Taxpayers with private property would have to pay an additional $888 (although that number varies based on the property value, as shown in <em>Figure 1.1</em>).<br>With the excess override money, many town services would recieve desperately needed money. The portion for the capital budget, for example, would address the backlog of repairs, maintenence, and replacements, and add qualified staff to manage assets and projects to help the capital stay current and up to date. The Senior Center, now with an increased demand due to the baby boom generation reaching seniority, would also recieve financial support to help the at-risk seniors, especially with COVID-19 in the mix.<br>School staffing would balance with the current enrollments, decreasing class sizes in middle and high school (by comparison, some classes have 30+ students in them), and the transitions to the new middle and high school only help. The current changes to the district, with the construction of the new Middle and High Schools, cause overcrowding. Solutions could be delivered and promises fulfilled with the excess override money. Changes to the public school system are described in <em>Figure 1.2</em>. The current Middle School splits to create enviroments that are age-appropriate to the students.</p>

    <h3><br>What would happen if Question 1 doesn't pass?</h3>
    <p>The current deficit (when the expenses accelerate faster that the revenue) would be filled an additional $1.9 million from the reserves (which, alongside the current reserves used, totals to $6.6 million) and $350 thousand from OPEB (other post-employment benefits) payment reductions. The remaining $3.45 million of deficit would come from departmental and capital budget cuts. A broken down list of the origin of the deficit, alongide the filling if the override fails, is displayed in <em>Figure 2.1</em>. Unfortunately, this isn't enough in the long run. In the following fiscal year, an $8-11 million override, or a supplementary $5-8 million in cuts.<br>$1.38 million from, 40% of, the initial $3.45 million of cuts this year would originate from the town services, from the subtraction of supplies listed in <em>Figure 2.2</em>. Not only will much needed funds be unavailable to the services that perilously desire them, but losses from other services and departments, such as the Fire and Police Departments and Building Inspection, that cause overtime for those remaining, and even loss of services for the general public, would effect the smoothness of the community.<br>School services lose $2.07 million from, 60% of, the initial $3.45 million of cuts. District-wide, educators, support staff, administrators, supplies, and extra-curriculars and programs would reduce, as outlined in <em>Figure 2.3</em>. However, the reductions would be strategized and prioritized. For example, the ELementary Special Education Chair is prioritized, causing a reduction in the positions removed for the Elementary grades, increasing the reductions within the other grades. Class sizes would increase, programs and activities would be lost, transportation and Tech Department services would be limited, and involuntary school reassignments at the Elementary level would occur. Overall, the classes would be inpersonal and nonsocial, and access to the classes would complicate. In other words, the work done since 2015 would be reversed. Our current school transitions are in jeopardy.</p>
